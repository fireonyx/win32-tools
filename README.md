# Experience the power of FireStone.
This architecture required fully custom, robust hardware. Maybe you don't want to buy or trust us yet, so
I guess you could use this. This is semi-official, we care about this project, but considering its based on windows, the very platform
we are trying to get away from it.

**This project will be maintained officially by FireOnyx and the GitHub community.**

# Recommended Hardware
 - OS: Microsoft Windows 11+ (64-bit)
 - CPU: Intel Core i9-9900K or AMD Ryzen 7 3700X
 - GPU: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 or AMD Radeon RX 6900 XT
 - RAM: 32GB

**Why are the specifications so high?**
This is an emulator, not a joke, emulators are extreemly complex as they are literally trying to trick software by simulating the execution of real electronic circuits. This is like simulating atoms, but lighter. With this extra overhead, don't be surprised by garbage performance on weak hardware.
